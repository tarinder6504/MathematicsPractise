Consider two points, and . We consider the inversion or point reflection, , of point across point to be a rotation of point around

.

Given
sets of points and , find for each pair of points and print two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of and on a new line.


Solutions:-

for i in range(int(raw_input())):
    px, py, qx, qy = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print ("{0} {1}".format(2*qx-px, 2*qy-py))
